# SimpleTransformers

Here is a basic implementation of some uses of transformers, ranging from sentence similarity to basic classification tasks. Look in the Jupyter notebook `SentenceTransformers.ipynb` for for further discussion.

## Usage

If you don't need to run the code, just look through the notebook for discussion points. But, to run it locally, the process is simply:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook SentenceTransformers.ipynb
```
